Plotting Taco locales
Laredo Taqueria locations pulled from their website with the intent of eventually mapping them versus other 
common fast food chains, Whataburger, Subway

The dataset is somewhat janky to start because it comes from repeated copy/pasting from Laredo website

I think it will first need to be converted from one column to multiple, separating, the address from the restaurant number and other information..

but! just having a go, so let me know what you think
